    <h2>Haikyuu!!</h2>

    <style>
        img {
            display: block;

    <p>There are not many sports anime that can knock it out of the park in almost every way but Haikyuu!! manages to do that. The series revolves around a fairly large ensemble consisting of a high school volleyball team. Even though that may seem like
        a hurdle, the character development is well balanced and you’ll find yourself rooting for each member whether their role is big or small. The animation from Production IG is top-notch as well, elevating the tension of each match and play to the
        point that you’ll be glued to the front of your screen all episode. Haikyuu!! succeeds in creating an amazing sports team formula that other similar series should strive for.</p>
    <h2>Dragon Ball Z</h2>

    <p>Dragon Ball Z was a gateway drug for many a young anime fan, and for good reason. The series isn't particularly deep, as it basically revolves around superhuman martial artist Goku and his friends testing their mettle against an increasingly powerful
        and outlandish series of foes. But what the series lacks in terms of plot, it more than makes up for in humor, kooky characters and incredible action. How can you not have fun with a martial arts fantasy where most of the characters are strong
        enough to shatter planets with their bare hands?</p>
    <h2>Made in Abyss </h2>
    <img src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/09/22/madeinabyss-1663869946626.jpg?fit=bounds&width=1280&height=720&dpr=2 " style="height: 350px;width: 550px; " />
    <p>Made in Abyss is rare in that it’s a story that could barely be told in any medium besides manga or anime, and takes full advantage of it to weave a fascinating, gut-wrenching story fueled by both despair and hope in equal measure. Riko and Reg live
        in a fascinating world with a deep, mysterious “abyss” at the center of it all.</p>
    <h2>Jojo's Bizarre Adventure</h2>

    <p>Oh my god! This is a normal response from watching this weirdly amazing shounen anime that follows the different generations of the Joestar family. The influential manga series has been around since 1987 and has only been airing the anime since 2012.
        It was tough to decide on which part of the long-running series was deserving of this spot so we’re taking all of this bizarre series into account. </p>
    <h2>Naruto Shippuden </h2>
    <img src="assets/css/images/naruto-shippuden.jpeg" style="height: 350px;width: 550px; " />

    <p>The long-running Naruto series has been referred to as one of the “big three” anime because of its wild popularity around the world, and for good reason. It’s full of action-packed fight sequences, hilariously fun moments, and dramatic scenes that
        pull at your heartstrings. In Naruto Shippuden, the story takes a darker and more serious tone as the characters are now older and face even more daunting challenges from the shadows as well as themselves. </p>
